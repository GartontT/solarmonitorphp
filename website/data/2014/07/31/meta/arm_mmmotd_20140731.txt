</address> <pre> </pre> <p> Dear RHESSI Collaborators,
<p>The level of solar activity is low. Yesterday's target (NOAA
12127) was responsible for a C9.0 flare on 30-Jul-20014 at
16:17 UT, the largest since the last message. The region
maintains the largest spot area. Adjacent region NOAA
12130 released a series of C-class flares. Limited FOV
instruments should focus on NOAA 12127 but include 12130,
if possible. Further C-class activity is expected with a chance
for a low M-class flare.
<p>The position of NOAA 12127 on 30-July-2014 18:20 UT is:
<p>S08W01, ( 19&quot;, -224&quot; )
